# SwEng Project

In the course of the semester you will apply most of the concepts introduced in the course in an Android environment.

This is a very realistic environment in which to apply your new knoweledge (as it's used a lot to develop real software shipped to real users). It is also the environment in which you will develop next semester in the SDP (Software Development Project) course.

This project **is not graded**. However, we still expect you to work on it each week. We will publish one handout every week, as well as the solution and code to the previous week. In this project, you will re-use the same code during the whole semester, adding new features, refactoring... It is therefore best to work on it regularly.

## Week 1: Intro

Find the handout here: [01-Intro/Handout.md](01-Intro/Handout.md)

Solution will be published next week.
